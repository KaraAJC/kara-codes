## About This Blog
This is my second iteration of a professional blog, the first being a site I built from scratch for Dev Bootcamp's Phase-Zero in 2014. Since then, many of my posts have gone to [Medium](https://medium.com/@karaajc), and I've been excited to bring my content back into my own control, with a snazzy domain name.

If you want to review my portfolio, you can find that at [https://KaraAJC.github.io](https://KaraAJC.github.io).
