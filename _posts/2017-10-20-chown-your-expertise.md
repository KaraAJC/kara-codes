Today I spent a lot of time preparing for [Write/Speak/Code] Chicago's Own Your Expertise workshop, but I paused for a moment to remind myself what `chown` command is.

[`chown`](http://www.linfo.org/chown.html) is a linux command that's really a shorthand for saying **Change Owner**. It's used to set permissions for files, directories and links in on a given computer.

Doing a bit of digging, I found a great article from [Julia Evans](https://twitter.com/b0rk) about their dive into linux commands called [You can be a kernel hacker!](https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/18/you-can-be-a-kernel-hacker/) and I'm super excited to get more of these commands under my belt.
