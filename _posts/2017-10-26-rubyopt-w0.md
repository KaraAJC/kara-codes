## Like, W0.

Today, I had ENOUGH of the damn deprication errors letting folks know that ruby has [merged BIGNUM and FIXNUM to Integer](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2016/12/25/ruby-2-4-0-released/), and I went on the hunt for the cure. Mostly, folks have referred to this error as something "upgrading rails will fix" but I use repositories that have active record gems on their own. so without dealing with the pending upgrade of all these repositories to the latest gems, I found you can use the following script in your bash profile to rid yourself of the warnings:

```sh
export RUBYOPT="-w0" rspec
```

the following article helps explain this in the clearest way, which I appreciated.
