We've Come to the End Of the Line
Today, I spent some time learning more about what config settings you can get done in order to do git properly. I read through this article: [Mind The End Of Your Line](http://adaptivepatchwork.com/2012/03/01/mind-the-end-of-your-line/), that discusses what happens with EOL settings, and how you can configure it to change based on whether an EOL is set or not, and if it was configured based on mac/windows. interesante!!
Looking forward to having no EOL errors posted up in github!
