Today I spent some time pairing with a colleague, and needed to build a signature for an API call they needed to make, 
so I took to the googles and learned a bit about how Ruby deals with Base64.

If you've never heard of Base64, it's a numeral system, or **BASE**-ically a standard for counting. 
We're most familiar with Base10 _i.e._ counting to 10 then starting over `0123456789`, or Base2 _i.e._ the Binary system that computers use `01`.

Base64 uses uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, AND a few symbols to get the job done!

In ruby, you can use the Module Base64 to encode or decode things!
Here's an example:

```rb

# First, the Base64 Module isn't in Core ruby, so you have to require it
 
require "base64"
=> true

# you can use the method #encode64 and give an argument, and see it translated to Base64!
enc = Base64.encode64("kara is awesome")
=> "a2FyYSBpcyBhd2Vzb21l\n"

# you can even be super sleuth and double encode it! (
double_enc = Base64.encode64(enc)
=> "YTJGeVlTQnBjeUJoZDJWemIyMWwK\n"

# Then to revert back to your original messages, you use the method #decode64
revert = Base64.decode64(double_enc)
=> "a2FyYSBpcyBhd2Vzb21l\n"

plain = Base64.decode64(revert)
=> "kara is awesome"

```
