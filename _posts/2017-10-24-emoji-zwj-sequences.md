Last night, I got started researching for my mini talk about emoji, and I kept seeing the term sequences, which made me recall photos i've seen before of adding or removing an emoji character will change a resulting emoji.

Today I learned that has to do with the "Zwidge", or `ZWJ` which means Zero Width Joiner; an invisible unicode character that joins multiple emoji characters together to make a new emoji.
[Here's an article (with a video!)](https://blog.emojipedia.org/emoji-zwj-sequences-three-letters-many-possibilities/) that discusses it further.

I'm also on the prowl for a presentation about emojis that was done during the Chrome Web Summit this past week!
