`#GreatGatsby`

Today, I continued my research on JAMstacks and finally deployed something with netlify. I decided to go with Gatsby instead of Hugo, since it's built for React, and I'd like to be able to build more on React.

I went through gatsby's opening tutorials, and it's a pretty quick uptake on getting pages up and running!

I'm also happy to note that it uses GraphQL, which I'm excited to get to know more about.

My goal will be to build my mom a site that she can share her daily health tips, and hopefully make new friends here in Chicago. I'm not sure that this will be the final tool I'm looking for, but I'm excited to find out.
