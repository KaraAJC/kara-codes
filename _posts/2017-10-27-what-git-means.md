I went on a tiny rabbit hole to determine whether the term `git` actually stood for something.

Googling git, I actually got this amusing tidbit:
![definition of git](/pics/git-definition.png)

then, I realized, that the above definition _actually influenced_ the author of git, Linus Torvalds (creator of Linux), to name the program as such. There are other acronyms for the software, the nicest being **G**lobal **I**nformation **T**racker, but Torvald's purpose for choosing git was that it was a

> random three-letter combination that is pronounceable, and not actually used by any common UNIX command. The fact that it is a mispronunciation of "get" may or may not be relevant.

Interesante, no?
