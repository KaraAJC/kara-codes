Apparently, `FactoryGirl`, a Gem that uses the factory pattern to build mocks needed for a test to appropriately run model dependencies, has been renamed to `FactoryBot`.

I have complicated feelings about the change, but it created bugs, and quite a nasty conversation in github.

Here's what Thoughtbot, owner of the gem, [had to say about the change:](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/factory_bot)
