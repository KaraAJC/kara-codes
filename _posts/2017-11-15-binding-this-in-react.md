The keyword `this` is one of my most favorite topics, mostly because it makes you feel weird saying `this` for a long time afterwards.

When learning how to implement ES6 AND React, as the students have been doing today, the concept becomes quite a bit more complex, both for them AND for me!

To help explain, I made these cute source images, with [Carbon](http://bit.ly/CarbonSoCute) and I hope they help you as much as they help me!

### 1: Bind `this` in a Classes constructor

### 2: Bind `this` within the event listener

### 3: Bind `this` within the event listener, using an arrow function

### 4: Bind `this` by using a class field property on the triggered function
