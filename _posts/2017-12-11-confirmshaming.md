`#NoMeansNo`

Today I learned that the phrase for a website hating on people making decisions for themselves, is called **Confirmshaming**.

I learned about this term after finding yet another [adorable Interactive Advent Calendar](http://redonion.se/calendar/) from another Dev Bootcamp alum, this time giving gifts of knowledge about web and design.

Day One discusses the topic, and defines `Confirmshaming` as
> a very aggressive type of marketing, where the general idea seems to be that if the carrot doesnâ€™t do the job, the stick will.

What immediately came to mind is "negging" or back-handed compliments, but in reality, it's about not letting a person say no, which is classic **BULLY TACTICS**.

To see some examples, you can check out this [confirmshaming tumblr feed](http://confirmshaming.tumblr.com/) full of confirmation modals from sites that chastize you for choosing not to do whatever it is they're trying to get you signed up for.

If you work on a team, and see a UI like this, do us all a favor, and let your UI team know they're Confirmshaming the user, and it's not cool at all.

Here's a [few more](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/shaming-users/)  [indepth articles](http://redonion.se/en/the-dark-side-of-web-design-confirmshaming/), and if you haven't already, I'd check out [Consentual Software](http://consensualsoftware.com/), as I'm sure their work keeps you from doing things like this anyway.
