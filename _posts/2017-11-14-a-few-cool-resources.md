`#SuchCoolSoWow`

## prepare to go down a rabbit hole!

Today, I found out about a lot of cool things folks are making, and it reminds me that tiny things can often times be the most impactful things we can make!

Here are a few amazing things you should check out:

### - [Appolition](https://appolition.us) :

This is a new app launched today that will collect round-up change from your every-day purchases and donate it on your behalf towards bailing out incarcerated folks. This is such a powerful project, I just may talk about it in it's own post soon. you should sign up!!

### - [Using Trello as a CMS](https://codepen.io/cmho/post/using-trello-as-a-cms) :

Carly Ho just shared this post they made a while back, but it BLEW MY MIND! I was aware that you could use

### - [Woof.js](http://woofjs.com/) :

Earlier this summer, my niece and nephew wanted to build a game, and I said, _OK, sure, I can figure out how to do that!_, and I discovered **Woof.js**. just go to the site, and play with it, it's my absolute favorite!

### - [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) :

This is a super cute app that lets you make images of code snippets, I'm going to use the images I made in a new post very soon!

### - [Alchemy](https://dawnlabs.io/blog/alchemy/) :

After reading about the creators of **Carbon**, I learned about another tiny tool they created called Alchemy, which is a simple way to get a bunch of images and translate them into a PDF file. It reminded me that I need to checkout Electron, and that react can be used for more than just web apps.
